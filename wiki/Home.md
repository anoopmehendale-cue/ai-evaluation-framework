# AI System Evaluation Framework - Wiki

Welcome to the AI System Evaluation Framework wiki. This resource provides a structured, practical approach to evaluating AI systems before and after deployment.

## 📚 Quick Navigation

- **[The 5-Step Framework](1-Five-Step-Framework.md)** - Overview of the evaluation methodology
- **[Defining Success Metrics](2-Success-Metrics.md)** - How to define and measure success
- **[Evaluation Strategies](3-Evaluation-Strategies.md)** - Three-tier approach to testing
- **[Stakeholder Involvement](4-Stakeholder-Involvement.md)** - Who to involve and when
- **[Iteration & Improvement](5-Iteration-Improvement.md)** - Continuous improvement cycles
- **[System Types & Examples](6-System-Types-Examples.md)** - Common AI systems and how to evaluate them
- **[Templates & Checklists](7-Templates-Checklists.md)** - Ready-to-use evaluation tools

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This framework helps you answer:
- Is my AI system ready to launch?
- What metrics should I track?
- How do I test this systematically?
- Who needs to be involved in evaluation?
- How do I improve when things don't work?

## 🚀 Quick Start

**New to AI evaluation?** Start here:

1. **[The 5-Step Framework](1-Five-Step-Framework.md)** - Get the big picture
2. **[Defining Success Metrics](2-Success-Metrics.md)** - Define what "good" looks like for your system
3. **[Evaluation Strategies](3-Evaluation-Strategies.md)** - Learn how to test effectively

**Ready to evaluate a specific system?**

1. Review **[System Types & Examples](6-System-Types-Examples.md)** for similar systems
2. Use **[Templates & Checklists](7-Templates-Checklists.md)** to structure your evaluation
3. Consult **[Stakeholder Involvement](4-Stakeholder-Involvement.md)** to plan engagement

## 💡 Key Principles

The framework is built on five principles:

1. **Business-First** - Always connect to business value
2. **Pragmatic** - Balance thoroughness with speed
3. **User-Centric** - User experience matters most
4. **Risk-Aware** - Understand what can go wrong
5. **Iterative** - Continuous improvement, not one-time evaluation

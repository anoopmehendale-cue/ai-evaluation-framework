## 💡 Key Concepts

**Compound AI Systems** combine multiple components:
- Multiple AI models (specialized vs general)
- Retrieval systems for knowledge
- Traditional software for structured logic
- Human oversight at critical points
- Feedback loops for improvement

**Why Compound AI?**
- **Reliability** - Easier to debug and fix issues
- **Performance** - Each component optimized for its role
- **Cost** - Use smaller models where appropriate
- **Control** - Explicit logic for critical decisions
- **Improvement** - Target weak components specifically
